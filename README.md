# Pulse Bridge Backend

A TypeScript-based backend service for mapping and transforming healthcare data between different EHR systems.

## Build and Run Instructions

To build and run the Pulse Bridge Backend:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Node.js (v14 or higher)
   - npm (comes with Node.js)

2. **Installation**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Development Mode**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the server in development mode with hot-reloading enabled.

4. **Production Build**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```
   This will:
   - Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
   - Copy the mappings directory to the dist folder
   - Start the server in production mode

The server will be available at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Performance Measures

To ensure that the system remains performant as it scales, the following strategies will be implemented:

1. **Caching**: 
   - Implement in-memory caching for frequently accessed EHR mappings using a simple object or a library like Redis to reduce file I/O operations.

2. **Asynchronous Processing**: 
   - Utilize asynchronous file operations (e.g., using `fs.promises`) to prevent blocking the event loop during read/write operations in the `utils.ts` file.

3. **Load Balancing**: 
   - If deploying in a production environment, consider using a load balancer (like Nginx or AWS ELB) to distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of the API.

4. **Database Optimization**: 
   - Plan for future database integration by ensuring that any data storage solution is optimized with proper indexing and efficient query structures.

## Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy will be designed to ensure the reliability and performance of the API:

1. **Unit Testing**: 
   - Use a testing framework like Jest to write unit tests for utility functions, validation logic, and controller methods.

2. **Integration Testing**: 
   - Conduct integration tests to verify that the mapping of input data to EHR systems works correctly, especially in the `controller.ts` and `service.ts` files.

3. **Load Testing**: 
   - Use tools like JMeter or Locust to simulate high traffic and assess how the API performs under stress, identifying potential bottlenecks.

4. **End-to-End Testing**: 
   - Implement end-to-end tests to validate the entire workflow from user input to EHR submission, ensuring all components function correctly together.

5. **Monitoring and Logging**: 
   - Integrate a logging library (like Winston) to log important events and errors, and set up monitoring to track API performance in real-time.

By implementing these performance measures and testing strategies, the API will be better equipped to handle increased loads while maintaining reliability and efficiency.
